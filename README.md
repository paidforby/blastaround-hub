# blastaround-hub
a hub for interactive scooters

This is a flask app being written to act as central hub for a swarm of interactive scooters. It is intended to be run on a raspberry pi with a 7in touchscreen, but could run on any given 'nix box.  
 
It will communicate with scooters over a LAN using the MQTT protocol.
